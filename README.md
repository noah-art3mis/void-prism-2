you are stuck in the void forever. it's only you and the cubes. they are a bit standoffish.  
in this first-person puzzle game you push blocks around. either sublimate your anger about being eternally stuck here by assembling nice sculptures with your new friends or enact righteous vengeance by wreaking (ultimately pointless) havoc upon the denizens of this wretched place.  
sometimes the blocks dont listen to you. especially if you try to rotate them. they don't seem to like being pushed around - but will do so out of pity.  
these world's rules make no sense to you. beware: if you finally understand what's happening -- please tell me. so i can fix the bugs and make this playable. thanks.  

### controls:
W / A / S / D - move your body  
mouse - move your head  
Q / E / shift / ctrl - move block (...maybe)  
1 / 2 / 3 - turn block (...in some direction)  
esc - "leave"  

### this was made in 10 days:
entry for godot wild jam #53  
theme: assembly required  
wildcard: four colors only  

### this could be better:
fix: html5 makes mouse move right on its own for some reason  
fix: html5 makes audio laggy  
fix: make the collisions work properly  
fix: make the blocks rotate predictably  
fix: make the blocks translate with relation to camera  
add mode: generate a sculpture and try to replicate it
