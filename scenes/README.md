# Void Prism

you are stuck in the void forever. it's only you and the cubes. they are a bit standoffish.  

Play at: []  

in this first-person puzzle game you push blocks around.  either sublimate your anger about being eternally stuck here by assembling nice sculptures with your new friends or enact righteous vengeance by wreaking (ultimately pointless) havoc upon the denizens of this wretched place.  



sometimes the blocks dont listen to you. especially if you try to rotate them. they don't seem to like being pushed around - but will do so out of pity.  

these world's rules make no sense to you. beware: if you finally understand what's happening -- please tell me. so i can fix the bugs and make this playable. thanks.

### this was made in 10 days:
entry for godot wild jam #53  
theme: assembly required  
wildcard: four colors only  


### this could be better:
fix: make the collisions work properly (destroy)  
fix: make the blocks rotate properly (predictably)  
fix: make the blocks translate properly (with relation to camera)  
add mode: generate a sculpture and try to replicate it
